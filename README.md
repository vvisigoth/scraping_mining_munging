#Scraping Mining Munging

Did you know that humans are responsible for only 39% of internet traffic? The rest is composed of bots, applications, scripts, golems and fairy dust? What are they doing? Aren't you jealous of how much fun they're having? Well, no more! In this class, we'll learn how to use clever workarounds and hacks to join the data party and access that sweet, sweet torrent of information that was originally meant for other machines. Don't worry, we won't get our hands tooooo dirty ;) In the process, you'll learn about the inner workings of the internet, HTTP, SSL, URLs, HTML, JavaScript and more! We'll also be learning how to do some basic scripting in Python on the way.
